# gcat_connect: ssh convenience scripts

I am pretty sure this is not the first the ssh convenience scrpit nor the last, but hey at least this is an
attractor point after evolution started from a (bunch of) bash scripts.

## pros
- convenient

## cons 
- password in files, unsafe
- dependency on python3.8. could use pyinstaller to partially improve
- dependency on ssh, sshpass, sshfs
